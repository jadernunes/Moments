                    "description": "Not a selfie! I've never typed 'please read', but I need the world to know about my boy. \n\nThis is my 13 year old son Ryan. He tragically lost his life last night. I'm laying next to his hospital bed as I type this. He was pronounced last night at 9:45pm. He is still on a ventilator and his heart is still beating because he is donating all his organs so others might have a chance at life. He is my hero. \n\nRyry was the goofiest, funniest, happiest, most loving kid I've ever had the pleasure of knowing and loving. He was on imgur constantly, just like daddy. We were always trading memes while I was at work and it made my day awesome. His other passion was gaming. You could hear him laughing and carrying on at just about any hour of day or night. He would have played Xbox 24 hours a day if we let him. Nerf guns!! There are Nerf darts in every corner of the house from him. He loved to ambush his step sisters and step mother, then run away laughing. His food was PBJs and loved Mallomars. \n\nHe stayed out of trouble, was my wingman on countless adventures and bike rides, and was the favorite family member of our dog Barley. \nRyan developed epilepsy at age 10. Thursday he went for a quick nap after school and never woke up. He had a seizure in his sleep that ultimately took his life. \n\n13 is not enough time. Not sure how I'll make it without my little man. He was loved by everyone, but none more than me.\n\nSorry this is long, I just wanted the world to know he was here. Happy adventuring little man! You're in my heart always. Daddy loves you.\n\nTLDR; The world lost an amazing boy yesterday.\n\nEdit: Imgurians- This is the community that me and Ryry talked about. Thank you all so much for the kind words and comments. \nYou guys have been amazing and have all made such a difference in this darkest time, and I just wanted to tell all of you how very much we appreciate you! \nRyry is so loved and will never be forgotten. \nThank you all.
